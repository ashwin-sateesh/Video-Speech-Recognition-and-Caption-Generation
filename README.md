# Video-Speech-Recognition-and-Caption-Generation

Our goal in this project was to develop an automated video speech recognition system (or a lip-reading model) that can detect and generate words spoken in a short video using only visual cues, with the aim of improving the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment.
